# Aesthetically-Pleasing-Trees

## Introduction
This piece of code is the solution for the aestheically pleassing garden problem.

## How to run
Please use the makefile to run and test the code:
* make build
* make run input="[1,4,6,2]" --> You can put your input
* make test

## Solution
At first I try to find subset of (n-1) size. Then for each subset check if it is aesthetically pleasing
or not.
